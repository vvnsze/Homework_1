    <h1>Welcome to the Basic Website of Vivian
    </h1>
    <hr>
      <p>This might be the most egotistical website mankind has yet to see, that being said
        <b>no one</b> can possible beat <em><a href="pages/donaldTrump.html">Donald Trump</a></em>.

    <h2>Why I want to Join MakerSquare
    </h2>
    <!--This is the part about Maker Square-->
      <p>Well, there are several reasons why I want to join MakerSquare. So here is a list:</p>
    <div>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>It's pretty fun</li>
          <li>My boyfriend is a software engineer. Watching him code made me curious</li>
          <li>Coding is similar to puzzles...and I like puzzles!</li>
          <li>I actually want to help my ex-boss make a better website</li>
          <li>Learning how to code is a skill that will benefit me no matter what my future holds</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
      <p>  Obviously, there are quite a few more reasons as to why software engineering can be so interesting.
      One of them can be the fact that I can say, "I know <em>four</em> languages, and one of them is Javascript!"
      seems pretty awesome, isn't it?! <b>Hahahahaha</b>, I'm so funny...:)
      <p>
    <!--This is the part about where I'm from-->
    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p>This isn't Fair. I'm not from one country. Granted, my passport is blue with the American eagle on it, but
        that doesn't mean it's the only culture that has influenced me! No No, let me tell you the different countries
        that have a huge influence on who I am!
      </p>
    <h3>Saipan: A Gem in the Middle of Nowhere</h3>
      <p>It's Hawaii without the bling bling. Don't get me wrong, Hawaii is chill but it you wanna be like Ron
        Swanson and just hermit yourself for a bit, this little dinosaur looking place is awesome! Click <a href="pages/childhoodInSaipan.html">here</a> for
        more information!
      </p>
    <h3>Guangzhou: China: Voracious City</h3>
      <p>People from all over China comes to Guangzhou. It's like the "California" of the United States. A great
        big mixing pot of the different ethnic food from the different provinces of China.Uhh, didn't I say "FOOD?!"
        Of course you wanna know more information about this gigantic food bowl!
      </p>
    <h3>California: The State that made "Mean Girls"</h3>
      <p>Okay fine. So we're more than just Hollywood. You can find every color of the rainbow when it comes to race here.
        I'll be honest, I had no clue about gays until I came to this ultra liberal state. I LOVE IT. OMG OMG OMG
        Did I say I love <a href="pages/america.html">CaleeForNia</a>?
      </p>
    <!--What'd I do? What'd I do?!?!?!?!-->
    <h2>What I do
    </h2>
      <p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>Tutor and Teach</li>
          <li>Make <a href="pages/food.html">Foooooood</a></li>
          <li>Previous Jobs</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    <!--I like big butts and I cannot lie!-->
    <h2>What I like
    </h2>
      <p>This isn't fair. There's no way I can possibly finish this section in a whole month, let alone one
        Makerprep session! Gahh...</p>
    <h2>What I want
    </h2>
      <p>So I got my two front teeth already. But what I do want is:
        <ul style="list-style-type: square">
          <li>All the makeup in the world!</li>
          <li>End world stupidity</li>
          <li>Hahaha the second point on this list is so cruel</li>
          <li>Narcissm at its best</li>
        </ul>  
      </p>
    <h2>My Dream Vacation</h2>
      <p>Of course I want to go with my loved ones and explore another country! If I had a choice, I would go visit
        Ireland</p>
